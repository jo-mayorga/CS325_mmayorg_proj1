Python script that takes in a text file containing prompts (seperated by lines) and outputs them to another text file.



Requirements:

-Create a conda environment using the supplied requirements.yaml

-Have Ollama and phi-3:mini installed



Usage:

In your terminal of choice with the activated environment, run "py project1.py [input file name] [output file name]".

For instance, "py project1.py prompts.txt responses.txt" reads in the file "prompts.txt" and outputs the model's response to "response.txt".
